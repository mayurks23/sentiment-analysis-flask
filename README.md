# 🔍 Sentiment Analysis Web App (Flask + ML)

A production-ready **Sentiment Analysis web application** built using **Python, Machine Learning, and Flask**, deployed on **AWS EC2**.  
The app classifies customer reviews as **Positive or Negative** in real time.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce reviews to understand customer sentiment and identify pain points from negative feedback.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment** as a complete end-to-end ML system.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify customer reviews into **Positive / Negative**
- Understand patterns behind negative sentiment
- Deploy an ML model as a **live web application**

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Flipkart Product Reviews  
- **Product:** YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle  
- **Total Reviews:** 8,500+  
- **Features include:**
  - Review Text
  - Rating
  - Review Title
  - Review Date
  - Upvotes / Downvotes
  - Location

## 🧠 ML Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Handling missing values
- Sentiment labeling based on ratings

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- N-gram representation
- Vocabulary size tuning

### 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
Trained and compared multiple models:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This project uses NLTK for text preprocessing.  
Before running the Flask application, please download the required NLTK resources once:

```bash
python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('stopwords')
>>> nltk.download('wordnet')
>>> nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```
## 🛠 How to Run Locally
```bash
python app.py
```
